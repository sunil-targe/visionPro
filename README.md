# Introducing VisionPro Sample App:
VisionPro Gitghub Follower Viewer is a test app developed using Swift and SwiftUI that seamlessly integrates for Apple VisionPro device. With this test app, users can explore and visualize th followers of a GitHub user in an elegant and user-friendly grid view. 

I used GitHub public API `https://api.github.com/users/USER/followers`, and fetches real-time data.

Test this app and feel free to raise your pull request.
